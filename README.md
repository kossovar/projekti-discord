# Projekti-Discord Clone

This project is a clone of Discord, focusing on creating a simplified version that captures the essence of Discord's user interface and experience. The project is structured into several key components, including the creation of servers, user creation, and user interface design. Here's a brief overview of what we've accomplished:

## Features

- **User Interface**: We've designed a user-friendly interface that mimics Discord's look and feel, utilizing CSS for styling. This includes a navigation bar, hero section, and various sections that provide information about the platform's capabilities. See `css/privacy.css` and `css/style.css` for styling details.

- **Server Creation**: Users can create their own servers, providing a description and an image URL. This functionality is implemented in `create_server.php`, with form styling in `css/create_server.css`.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. This is achieved through media queries in our CSS files, such as `css/privacy.css`.


## Technologies Used

- HTML & PHP: For structuring the web pages and server-side logic.
- CSS: For styling the application, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- JS: For animations and events in the site.
- FontAwesome: For icons used across the application.
